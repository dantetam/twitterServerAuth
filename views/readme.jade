h1 Twitter NLP Server
hr
p This is a node.js RESTful API served by express.js middleware, pug/jade templates, and a MongoDB/Mongoose schema and database.

p The index of this server lists all of the endpoints used for analysis, visualization, and calculation.

p This server creates a RESTful API by using the Twitter Search/Topic APIs to find tweet content, and delivers results using server-side NLP computations. Tweets, results, and other data are stored within the Mongoose database, and can be efficiently queried by the server. Moreover, this server uses async IO/callbacks to deliver results quickly.
